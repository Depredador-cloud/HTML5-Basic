MyRepository/
index.html

script.js
README.md
LICENSE
.gitignore
Let me explain what each file/folder does:

index.html: The main HTML file that will be displayed when someone visits your repository.
css/ folder: Holds your CSS files, including style.css which will be used to style your HTML.
images/ folder: Holds your image files, including logo.png which can be used as a logo for your repository.
js/ folder: Holds your JavaScript files, including script.js which can be used to add interactivity to your HTML.
README.md: A Markdown file that provides an introduction to your repository, including information about what it does and how to use it.
LICENSE: A file that specifies the license under which your repository is released.
.gitignore: A file that tells Git which files and folders to ignore when tracking changes.
